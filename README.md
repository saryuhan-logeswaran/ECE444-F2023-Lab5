There are many positives that come with test driven development. One of the main ones is that the testing is prioritized and is a fundamental component to the development process. This is because the tests are created before development and the development is made so it can pass the written tests. Often testing is done after the development and may not be thoroughly thought through as the team may just want to get the product out, and TDD helps avoid such situations. TDD also can help remove the need to manually test out everything, and makes it easier for different developers to ensure that their changes to the code doesnâ€™t break pre existing functionalities. A potential disadvantage of TDD is that it may add more to the time taken to complete tasks as we have to create tests prior to even developing. This new importance on the tests helps create better products but may not be helpful when the deadlines are tight and there is a lot of development to be done.
